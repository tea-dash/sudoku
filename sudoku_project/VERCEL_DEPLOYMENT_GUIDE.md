# Vercel Deployment Guide for Sudoku App

This guide will help you deploy your Sudoku application on Vercel.

## Deployment Method 1: Using Vercel Dashboard (Recommended for First-Time Setup)

1. Go to [Vercel's website](https://vercel.com) and sign up/login (you can use your GitHub account)
2. Click on "Add New..." > "Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository (grant Vercel access to your repository if needed)
4. Configure your project:
   - Framework Preset: Other
   - Root Directory: `./` (leave as is)
   - Build Command: Leave empty (or use `pip install -r requirements.txt` if needed)
   - Output Directory: Leave empty
   - Install Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Click "Deploy"

Vercel will automatically detect your `vercel.json` configuration and deploy your application.

## Deployment Method 2: Using Vercel CLI

If you prefer using the command line:

1. Install Vercel CLI:
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

2. Login to Vercel:
```bash
vercel login
```

3. Deploy the project (run this from your project root):
```bash
vercel
```

4. Follow the prompts:
   - Set up and deploy? Yes
   - Which scope? (Select your account)
   - Link to existing project? (Select No for first time, Yes for updates)
   - What's your project name? sudoku
   - In which directory is your code located? ./
   - Want to override settings? No

## Updating Your Deployment

After making changes to your code:

1. Commit and push your changes to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your update message"
git push
```

2. If you've set up GitHub integration, Vercel will automatically redeploy your application.

3. Alternatively, redeploy manually:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Import Error**: Make sure your directory structure is correct and all Python modules can be imported
- **Dependencies Issue**: Verify your `requirements.txt` file includes all necessary packages
- **Routing Problem**: Check the `vercel.json` configuration to ensure all routes are correctly defined

## Production URL

After deployment, your application will be available at:
- https://sudoku-[your-username].vercel.app (default)
- Or the custom domain you've configured

You can always check deployment status in your Vercel dashboard.
